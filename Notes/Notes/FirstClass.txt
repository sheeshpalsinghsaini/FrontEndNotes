>How Internet works?
->Resource:[used to do something meaningfull work]
    -files
    -Network Capacity 
=>Resource available inside computers(files)
=>Sharing of Resource
    -copy the file to a pen drive=>transport the pendrive=>copy the file on a different PC.
    -not very scalable(1 million users want the file at the same time)
    -put your file on a Network(connect to their Network and download the file)

-Servers
  =>Servers are owners/managers of these Resource(eg. files)

-Clients
  =>users/computers/machines that want the file


Explorer(use to explore the Network and see which file are present)
->in Internet Area need Internet Explorer

Browser:
    ->Applications that help us in exploring other Network
    ->Browsers acts as a Client on your behalf=>GUI[we can use cmd #curl google.com]

GUI(Graphical User Interface)
CLI(Command-line user Interface)


GUI: Browser is GUI 
-> Need to display something[button,link etc]=>someone needs to code it.
-> you can't code in any language(the browser does not understand everything)

#What is that subset of things that the browsers understand?
    ->HTML(Hypertext Markup(used for describing or introduce behavior) language)
    ->CSS(Cascading Style Sheet)
    ->JS(JavaScript)
        =>DOM
            =>React
        =>AJAX
        =>BOM
    ->WASM(Web Assembly) very recent addition to the browser




======================= HTML ===================================
It is Markup language
(just "describing" structure of the page=>cannot be used(generally) to introduce behaviour)

-XML(eXtensible Markup language)

What does HTML use for describing the structure of a page?
=>structure of a page=>header+footer+paragraph+links+etc


# Pre-define Elements/tags:
    =>Attributes


How to write elements?(i.e its syntax)
=> <html>This is tag declaration starting and ending tags</html>

Font name,size,color=>chosen by the browser by default(default style/user agent style)



=========tags===========
>Headings: use h1 to h6 tag 
>paragraph: use p tag

===============form==========================
form(method,action), input (email,text,password,date url,radio,checkbox,range,color),
select, name, value, inline elements, block elements, div, span, comments, CSS Basics
(inline, internal, class, id, properties(fonts, color, text))

sub tag used for =subscript(logarithmic formulas)

=> Elements
    -inline elements(span)
        do not start on a new line
    -block elements (div)
        always start on a new line (even when the previous line has space)

=======================CSS[Cascading Style Sheet] Rule=======================
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements.
These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed.

                Adjacent Sibling Selector
The adjacent sibling combinator(+) separates two selectors matches the second
element only if it immediately follows the first element, and both are children
of the same parent element.

                General Sibling Selector
Matches an element that is a sibling of another, although it does not have to be the
directly preceding element 
e.g h1 ~p{

}

if you had two <p> elements that are siblings of an <h1> element, 
this rule would apply to both
